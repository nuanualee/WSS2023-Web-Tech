    <h2>Pozzarello</h2>

    The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the year 1200 as the home ofthe gardner who tended the grounds of the adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us nice and cool inside, despite the blistering mid-day heat. This is the view from our bedroom window.

    <h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>

    This is the scene on the way to Montalcino (all roads lead to Montalcino!). It looks a lot like thescene on the way to Sienna, and the scene on the way to the grocery store. We were surrounded by beautiful countryside for most of our travels.

    <h2>Sienna</h2>

    The closest city to our villa was Sienna, about 30 minutes away. We spent many days exploring thesteep and crooked streets, sampling the local cuisine at outdoor restaurants, and stopping in the dark and echoey Duomo to escape the sun.
